## Project setup:
You just need to install [Deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface). 
It's going to install the library itself and its prerequisites as well.

```shell
$ pip install deepface
```
DeepFace is also available at Conda.
```shell
$ conda install -c conda-forge deepface
```
And you are ready to go.

## Getting Started
For only the emotions detection: 
```shell
$ python emotions_Deepface.py
```
For emotions + recognition (this one is a one line code fully using deepface):
```shell
$ python emotions_recognition_Deepface.py
```

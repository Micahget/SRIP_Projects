# SRIP_Project

- This is a repository for the SRIP project of IIT Gandhinagar.
- The project is about face detection and emotion recognition using openCV and deep learning.
- The project is divided into 2 parts:
  - Face detection
  - Emotion recognition
- The project is implemented using 3 different models:
  - Caffe model
  - Yunet model
  - Progressive Teacher model with MobileFaceNet backbone
- This repostory also contains a project which uses deepface library for emotion recognition. This program detects faces and displays the level of emotion on the face.
- The project is implemented in python.
